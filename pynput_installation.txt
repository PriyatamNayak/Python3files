since my scripts are running from anaconda python interpreter at backend. 

to check the running interpreter, add these to your script:
	import sys
	print(sys.version)

so , move the extracted folder to anaconda3 folder->open pynput directory and press 
"shft+rght click" , it will open powershell:
		or 
open cmd in pynput directory and type the command:

	python setup.py install
to install the setup files of pynput. run: import pynput in python interpreter to 
check the installation
