If after installation of module stil it shows "ModuleNotFoundError" while running 
script check the version of the python interpreter. 
1. In cmd type: 
	python
it will show the version of python interpreter 

2. Open the script and type:
	import sys
	print(sys.version)
you will see the version of the python which is running your script. 
If both are same and you still getting import error, install python or module again.

If both are not same, you have to move the file to the directory which is running the 
script
